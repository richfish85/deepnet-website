## Video Script Outline

### 1. Hook (0:00–0:20)
Lines you can use:

- “Linux boot flow isn’t random. It’s a chain of trust — or a chain of risk.”
- “If attackers compromise Linux early, nothing you run afterward matters.”

Visuals:  
UEFI → GRUB → kernel → initramfs → systemd.

---

### 2. The Problem (0:20–1:15)

Viewers struggle with:

- the difference between GRUB and systemd  
- what initramfs actually *does*  
- where kernel parameters matter  
- how persistence works in Linux  

They often treat Linux like a black box, which makes them blind to boot-stage attacks.

---

### 3. Core Teaching (1:15–5:30)

Explain each phase in one tight, intuitive sentence:

1. **Firmware**  
   - Hardware initialized, bootloader chosen, trust anchor established.

2. **Bootloader (GRUB)**  
   - Loads the kernel + initramfs, passes boot parameters.

3. **Kernel Loading**  
   - CPU transitions modes, memory manager activates, early drivers are prepared.

4. **Initramfs**  
   - Temporary userspace that mounts the real root filesystem.

5. **systemd / Init**  
   - PID 1 starts services, networking, logs, and overall service orchestration.

6. **User Session**  
   - Shells, desktops, SSH; normal operations begin.

One crystal-clear example:

- How a malicious initramfs can capture disk encryption passwords.

---

### 4. Security Angle (5:30–6:30)

- Bootloaders can disable SELinux/AppArmor.  
- Kernel parameters can neuter security.
- Initramfs integrity is critical but often overlooked.
- systemd unit files are a goldmine for persistence.

Key line:

- “Linux gives you power. Misconfiguring boot or early userspace gives attackers even more.”

---

### 5. Soft CTA (6:30–7:00)

**General audience:**  
“For clean diagrams and the full breakdown, check the Linux Boot Flow guide on DeepNet Docs.”

**Business audience:**  
“For Melbourne-based SMBs, this is part of how CyberGuard Core evaluates real security posture — not just surface-level checks.”

## X / Twitter Ideas

### Thread 1: Linux Boot in 8 Tweets

1. Linux doesn’t “just start”.  
2. Firmware initializes hardware and picks the loader.  
3. GRUB loads kernel + initramfs.  
4. Kernel activates memory + CPU modes.  
5. initramfs handles drivers + encrypted disks.  
6. systemd starts services and logs.  
7. Attackers love early boot footholds.  
8. Link → Linux Boot Flow doc.

### Micro-post
“initramfs is the most misunderstood security component in Linux.  
If an attacker tampers with it, you’re owned before your OS even mounts.”
