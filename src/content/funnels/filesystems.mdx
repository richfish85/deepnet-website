## Video Script Outline

### 1. Hook (0:00–0:20)

- “Everything you investigate — logs, binaries, persistence — lives inside a filesystem.”
- “If you don’t understand how storage works, you miss half the attack surface.”

---

### 2. The Problem (0:20–1:15)

Beginners think:

- filesystems = folders  
- deletion = gone  
- timestamps = reliable  
- permissions = copies from Windows Explorer  

But in reality:

- deletion just removes directory references  
- metadata persists  
- permissions are layered  
- attackers abuse features most people never see  

---

### 3. Teaching Blocks (1:15–5:30)

Focus on five short beats:

1. **Filesystem purpose**  
2. **Inodes & MFT**  
3. **Timestamps & metadata**  
4. **Journaling & recovery**  
5. **Permissions & ACLs**

One example to illustrate:

- Hidden payload inside NTFS ADS  
- Or a tampered SUID binary  

Both simple, strong teaching moments.

### 4. Security Angle (5:30–6:30)

“Your filesystem *is* the attack surface.”  
Explain quickly:

- persistence  
- tampering  
- forensics  
- privilege escalation  
- hidden payloads  
- evidence recovery  

---

### 5. Soft CTA (6:30–7:00)

- “Full diagrams and details are inside the DeepNet Filesystems guide.”
- “This is one of the things we examine inside CyberGuard Core to uncover hidden risks in client environments.”

## X / Twitter Ideas

### Thread:
1. “Your filesystem is a database.”  
2. Inodes/MFT explained simply  
3. Timestamps as forensic clues  
4. Journaling as recovery  
5. Hidden payloads  
6. Permission pitfalls  
7. CTA → Filesystems doc  

### Micro-post:
“Deletion doesn’t delete. It disconnects. Inodes/MFT still hold the truth.”
